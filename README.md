# High-performance-parallel-computing
Some codes to practice Parallel Computing
# Test1
Solve the quadratic equation x2 + 3x-5.6 = 0 by C and python.
#### for c
step1:cd test1

step2:make

step3:./test2
#### for python 
step1:cd test1

step2:python test1.py

# Test2
vector:Multiply result of two vectors designed by openmp(a parallel Compiler Directive)

prime:Calculate prime numbers between 2 and 1,000,000 using OpenMP programming and export the results to a file for comparison ; display the number of primes found on the screen and analyze the number of threads from 1 to 8 for acceleration Ratio。

schedule:Example and test OpenMP load balancing, respectively, using static, dynamic,guide and runtime,and show results.
